# Auctioneer
Auctioneer is a simple queued item auctioning service that you can use at events of your liking. The app is front end and uses firebase to handle authentication; sales, user currency and current auctions. Auctioneer provides a simple bidding and Admin User Interface to manage and auction with ease.

## Setup

 1. Clone or download the repository
 2. Navigate to the index.html , login.html and the signup.html files and paste in your firebase details
 3. Do the same with the gan.html file (This will be the admin panel)
 4. Now you can use a hosting provider to host your static website
 
 ## Security Risks
 Since the Auctioneer system is client side, this would expose your firebase keys; you can, however port this onto the server side to fix this issue.
